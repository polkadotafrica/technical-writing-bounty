# Polkadot Africa Technical Writing Bounty Rules

### Where to start?
The best way to start is setting up your wallet, creating your onchain identity and reading the lightpaper.

### Choosing a topic you want to write about.

Available topics are always outlined as Github issues. 

There are different tags for different types of contents.

- **Tutorials**: these are lessons with practical activities designed to teach the user some skills as they partake. An example would be "Create a DNS contract from scratch with ink!". [This](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is a guideline for what we'd be expecting.

- **How-to Guides**: these are clear instructions on how to do something specific. Though they may seem similar to tutorials, the distinction is that they are targeted towards practical problems users might want to quickly solve while trying to complete a task at work or while using a product. An example would be "How to create a custom token on the Polkadot network". [This](https://diataxis.fr/how-to/) is a guideline for what we'd be expecting.

- **Explanations**: these are expected to be discussions of concepts to provide understanding.  An example would be "A deep dive into what Polkadot is and why it was built". [This](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) is a guideline for what we'd be expecting.
