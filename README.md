# Polkadot Africa Technical writing(Tutorials) Rules

### Where to start?
The best way to start is setting up your wallet, creating your onchain identity and reading the lightpaper.

### Choosing a topic you want to write about.

Available topics are always outlined as Github issues. 

There are different tags for different types of articles.

- **content-writing**: these articles are expected to be less technical and more tailored to beginners, focusing on providing clear and accessible information. [This](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) is a guideline for what we'd be expecting.
- **tech-tutorials**: these are developer articles. they are expected to be heavily infused with much technical knowledge. For the avoidance of doubt, [this](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) is our definition of a tutorial.

Pick a topic, follow the resources provided to help you in your research, write using the provided outlines and get paid!
